# BootstrapScript
A sciprt to setup up all my linux enviornments with the needed software tools I will be using in Hack The Box.  This so if I can have identical setups from computer to computer.  The hardest about any setup is learning all of the new tools or features.  If I can keep a universal setup acorss systems it should hopefully make my life easier.
