# BootstrapScript
A simple Bootstrap script that I will be continuously using.  This so if I can have identical setups from computer to computer.  The hardest about any setup is learning all of the new tools or features.  If I can keep a universal setup acorss systems it should hopefully make my life easier.  Below is all the features that I use.

1. X-server (Display Server)
2. xinit (X-server launcher)
3. i3 (Tiling Windows Manger)
4. feh (Desktop Background)
5. Kitty (Terminal)
6. PolyBar (Customizable Status Bar)
7. Thunar (File Manger)
8. OpenVPN (VPN client)
9. PulseAudio / pavucontrol / alsa-utils (audio)
10. Firefox-esr (Internet Browser)
11. fonts-jetbrains-mono (Font)

# TODO:
- Need to add g++ compiler
- Need to test it and make sure it will work properly everytime
- polybar on laptop is different from desktop because of battery life
- Need to create a .bashprofile that starts x-server everytime after logging in via tty
- Need to create a "DotFiles" Directory
